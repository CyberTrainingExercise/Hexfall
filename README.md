### Objectives

For: POC
Time: 20-30 mins

Technical Objectives:
1. Intro to Kali Linux
2. Intro to brute forcing passwords
3. Intro to SSH

Tools:
1. Kali linux box
2. USB
3. Headless server with SSH port open

### Setup

1. Create a cloud server with an open SSH port and with login credentials as found in `passwords.txt`.
2. Run a website off of the cloud server.
3. Load a box with Kali linux and connect it to the internet.
4. Load a USB stick with the cloud server login credentials and location of the second weapons create.
5. Encrypt the file with the credentials found in `passwords.txt`.
6. Put the Kali box and USB stick in Hexfall HQ as described below.
7. Possible darknet stuff here.

### Scenario

Team is briefed with the following:

    Intel has located a nefarious hacking group, known only as Hexfall, in a nearby facility. Hexfall was brought to the the governments attention after they opened an online weapons marketplace. Due to increasing demand of black market guns, the store is shipping thousands of dollars worth of weapons daily. It is believed they have two crates of weapons onsite as well as the hardware to run their own online weapons marketplace. You are being tasked with taking down the operation. You must take down the online weapon marketplace and take control of both weapons crates.

    Additionally, it is believed Hexfall has a small infrastructure of computers. But, due to the sensitive nature of their network, it cannot be moved until the website is disabled. Therefore, you will be tasked with taking Hexfall's website offline on location.

    To do this it is believed Hexfall has a flash drive where they store the passwords to all their computers. You must obtain the flash drive, get the passwords, and take down the remote server.

    Your mission is complete when you take down the Hexfall website and take control of both weapons crates.
